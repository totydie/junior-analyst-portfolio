You are also given an integer forget, which means that each person will forget the secret forget days after discovering it. A person cannot share the secret on the same day they forgot it, or on any day afterwards.\n",

    "### Approach: Simulation + Deque\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Intuition\n",
    "We can directly simulate the process based on the description of the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "We use two deques, know and share, which represent people who know the secret (but will not share it) and people who will share the secret, respectively. Each element in these two deques is a tuple (day,cnt), where day indicates the day the secret becomes known, and cnt represents the number of people who know the secret on that day.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, on the first day, only one person knows the secret and will not share it, so know=[(1,1)] and share=[].\n",
    "\n",
    "On the i-th day (2≤i≤n):\n",
    "\n",
    "On the (i−delay)-th day, people who knew the secret start to share it. Therefore, if the first element of know is (i−delay,cnt), remove it and add it to the end of share.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the (i−forget)-th day, people who learned the secret forget it. Therefore, if the first element of share is (i−forget,cnt), remove it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Everyone in share teaches the secret to new people. Therefore, we add (i,cnt) to the end of know, where cnt is the sum of all counts in share.\n",
    "\n",
    "The time complexity of steps 1 and 2 is O(1), while step 3 is O(n) because it requires traversing share. Although this is sufficient to solve the problem within the limits, we can optimize it to O(1). We can maintain two variables, knowcnt and sharecnt, to store the sum of counts in know and share, respectively. In this way, the time complexity of steps 1 and 2 remains O(1), and step 3 is reduced to O(1) as well.\n",
